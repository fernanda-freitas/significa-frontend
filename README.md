# What's in Solution

This is a React application challenge I completed by building an IMDb movie search app. The challenge involved creating a functional and responsive app based on the provided screens as a reference. Throughout the development process, I retrieved JSON content from IMDb's API using a search mechanism, filtered the data, and displayed it on the movie's detailed page. I implemented a Like feature that works seamlessly within the app and designed two extra screens to predict responsiveness and a Not found component.

## Preview Extra screens

Two extra screens were created in order to predict responsiveness in the Movie page and the Not found state.

## Technologies Used

To accomplish the challenge, I utilized the following technologies and tools:

* **React:** React as the framework for building the application;

* **Create React App:**  I used Create React App as a boilerplate to quickly set up the initial project structure and build configuration;

* **React Router:**  I employed React Router to handle routing within the application, ensuring seamless navigation between different pages;

* **BEM:** Followed the BEM naming convention to write modular and scalable CSS code for enhanced maintainability;

* **Sass:** Utilized Sass for improved code organization and maintainability;

* **Adobe XD:** Utilized Adobe XD for designing two extra screens, one to predict the responsive behavior and one to illustrate the Not found state.
